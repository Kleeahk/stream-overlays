XXIV. Needle
When you've been hurt, it is natural to want to keep others away from your vulnerabilities. You don't have to let people see more of yourself than you are ready for, but don't forget that it is a choice you are making. The world or the forces that hurt you didn't make you incapable of letting others near. Only you can decide when you're ready to let down your guard. That means, sometimes, accepting that you've kept it up for too long.

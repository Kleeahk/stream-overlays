XV. Hammer
You have the strength to face oncoming challenges. Whatever form this strength comes in, it feels like a natural part of you. It can be direct, it can be flexible, but it is always powerful. Just don't mistake this source of strength for yourself. Remember that it is useless unless you guide it.

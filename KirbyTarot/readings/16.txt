XVI. Hi-Jump
Moving forward is important, but sometimes what life really needs is a lateral move, perpendicular from what you've been trained to expect. Lateral thinking is a skill that only develops with practice and intention. To others, such leaps may appear ridiculous or pointless, but by cultivating this ability, you're able to see the straight parade from a different angle.

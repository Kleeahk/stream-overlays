XXXXV. Goal
You did it! Boy, it feels good! Might even make you want to dance! Dance away, you've earned it. It took a lot to get here. And if you don't feel like you reached a goal? Well, maybe you have. Maybe not the ULTIMATE goal, but there's probably more reason to celebrate than you expect. Just consider it.
